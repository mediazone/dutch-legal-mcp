## Abstract

This paper presents the Dutch Legal MCP Server, a novel implementation of the Model Context Protocol specifically designed for Dutch legal research and regulatory compliance. The system provides programmatic access to over 800,000 court decisions from Rechtspraak.nl, implements automated GDPR compliance assessment, and offers EU AI Act classification capabilities. Through empirical validation using recursive self-analysis, the system demonstrated its practical utility by achieving 100/100 compliance score in its own GDPR assessment, establishing a benchmark for AI-assisted legal technology tools.

**Keywords:** Model Context Protocol, Legal Technology, GDPR Compliance, EU AI Act, Dutch Jurisprudence, Automated Legal Analysis

The digitization of legal research has created unprecedented opportunities for AI-assisted analysis of jurisprudence and regulatory compliance. The Dutch Legal MCP Server addresses the specific challenges of accessing and analyzing Dutch legal data through a standardized Model Context Protocol implementation.

### 1.1 Research Objectives

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of AI-assisted legal research tools through the development of a comprehensive MCP server that integrates multiple Dutch legal data sources and provides automated compliance assessment capabilities.

### 1.2 System Overview

The system implements five core functionalities:

| Function | Data Source | Coverage |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Court Decision Search | Rechtspraak.nl Open Data | 800,000+ decisions |
| GDPR Compliance Assessment | EU Regulation 2016/679 | Comprehensive scoring |
| AI Act Classification | EU AI Act 2024 | 4-tier risk assessment |
| Legal Risk Analysis | Combined framework | Multi-domain analysis |
| DPA Updates | Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens | Real-time guidance |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

## 4. Empirical Validation

### 4.1 Self-Analysis Experiment

**Methodology:** The system was configured to analyze its own website (mediazone.github.io/dutch-legal-mcp) for GDPR compliance, creating a recursive validation scenario.

**Initial Assessment:** 20/100 compliance score (HIGH RISK) with identified violations:
- Missing cookie consent mechanism
- Absence of privacy policy
- Unclear data retention periods

**Remediation Process:** Using the system's own recommendations, automated generation of compliant documents was performed:

```bash
# Execute meta-compliance validation
npm run meta-compliance

# Output demonstrates recursive legal intelligence
üéØ COMPLIANCE SCORE: 100/100
‚úÖ Status: GOOD COMPLIANCE
üö® VIOLATIONS FOUND: 0
```

**Generated Compliance Documents:**
- Cookie Consent Banner (`assets/js/cookie-consent.js`)
- Privacy Policy (`privacy-policy.html`)
- GDPR Compliance Report (automated assessment)
- Legal Risk Analysis (self-evaluation)

**Final Assessment:** 100/100 compliance score (PERFECT) achieved through systematic application of the system's own guidance.

### 4.2 Validation Significance

This recursive self-analysis establishes a novel benchmark for AI-assisted legal technology, demonstrating that properly designed systems can evaluate and improve their own compliance posture.
